						Our Project
					</h2>
					<p>
						We in the projekt group Morkulla recieved a project from the company Devolv to create an online calculator for cost relating to building houses.
						This tool is primarily made to enable customers to quickly see costs related to a home design already created in Devols other tools.
						The produce of this project became a webapplication which may come to be used at <a href="https://www.devolv.com/">Devolve's website</a>.
						During the project we worked with Svelte and TypeScript to create the website, and followed SCRUM for project organisation.

							<h3>Sprint 1</h3>
							<p>
								The project began here, our goals for this sprint were to implement basic site navigation, set up charts, and to finish the UX design of the website with approval from Devolve. <br>
								This went mostly well although we did not get a complete approval of the UX design. We also discovered problems with our communication with Devolve.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="sprintSlide">
							<h3>Sprint 2</h3>
							<p>
								For the second week of the project we determined that the goals were to improve communications with Devolve, improve the UX design so that it could be approved, refactor code, and to create a navigable dummy site. <br>
								The most important goal of these was to improve communications, which was achieved by compiling a list of what information we needed but did not have from Devolve in order to approve mutual understanding. <br>
								Moreover, the design were not fully approved again. With the design aside, everything went well.
							</p>
						</div> 
						<div class="sprintSlide">
							<h3>Sprint 3</h3>
							<p>
								Our goal for sprint 3 was to finish the website in such a capacity that it would work for its intended use by customers. This went resonably well in itself, but Devolve wanted to change some earlier design decisions which had us redo some work. We could not finish the entire base for the website because of the design changes.
								<br> We also began to have scarse work, there was not much more to do that could be parallelised for eight developers which made work assignment difficult.
